# NightmareVision Godot
A rewrite of NightmareVision with completely different Lua support than Psych, and (future) tighter compatibility with the base engine.

## ToDo
### High Priority
- [ ] Gameplay
    - [ ] Implement PlayField (currently just using Psych 0.5 method)
- [ ] Scripting
    - [ ] make able to call custom functions
- [ ] Rework Asset System
    - [ ] implement Mod/Content system
### Mid Priority
- [ ] Menus
- [ ] Modchart
    - The way it works should be based on FunkinModchart.
### Low Priority or Almost never
- [ ] Haxe/HScript
    - I plan to do this once I find a good godot haxe backend (or manually port the whole of HScript myself...)
